"""Harbor agent adapter for dimcode.

The dimcode under test is mounted read-only into the task environment as a
prebuilt image (see ``benchmarks/README.md``: the subject under test and the
harness are kept apart).
``install()`` therefore never touches the network. A no-network task opens
only the model API host for the agent phase, through the trial-level
``extra_allowed_hosts``; the task definition is never modified.

Metrics come from the Timeline export (``dimcode export``), dimcode's read path
for complete runs. Cost and turns are Primary gate metrics, so they are
extracted here rather than reconstructed later from trajectories.
