# Dim

Dim is a Rust coding agent with a terminal scrollback interface.

Install with Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=23.11.0` and optional dependencies enabled:

```sh
npm install -g dimcode
dim
```

The platform package contains the native CLI and App Server; installation does not download executables or run install scripts.

Use `dim --help` for configuration and session commands. Platform packages are built for macOS arm64/x64, Linux arm64/x64 and Windows arm64/x64. Availability depends on verified release artifacts.

TypeScript plugins can import named-service types with
`import type { PluginFiles, Settings, Sessions, AuxiliaryModel, ToolRegistry, SessionMethods, GuideEntries } from 'dimcode/plugin'`.
See the [plugin author's guide](https://github.com/arcships/dim/blob/main/docs/typescript-plugin-authoring.md).
The type-only entry adds no runtime code or plugin registration.

Dim's original source uses MIT. See `NOTICE` for distribution attribution. Native platform packages include `licenses/RUST-THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`, terminal library licenses under `licenses/grok-build/` and Aimux's license under `licenses/aimux/`. The optional `dimcode-web` package includes `web/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`, covering its JavaScript dependencies and Geist fonts under their own licenses. Bundled plugins retain the license files supplied by their npm packages.

## Client UI extensions

`dimcode/ui` exports browser types only. UI packages bundle their own runtime and
export `mount(ShadowRoot, context)` with a cleanup function. The host supplies
only declared capabilities and Session methods bound to the selected Session and
branch. See the [contract](../docs/design/client-ui-extensions.md) and
[HTML, CSS and JavaScript example](../examples/ui-extensions/README.md).
