# Skills: repository preview and selective installation

Status: Draft. Delivery status is tracked in the issue, not here.

Scope: process.
Issue: [#740](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/740).
Rules: [design rules](../../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md), [ADR 002](../../adr/002-plugin-scope.md).

This document owns one part of the Skills owner: how a Skill source that is not a Dim plugin
package is previewed, installed into the user scope, updated and removed. Skill discovery,
precedence, enablement, the Session view and the `skill` tool are the Skills capability's
existing contract ([Skills](../../architecture/rust-agent/plugins/Skills.md)); plugin packages
that carry Skills are PluginManager's ([PluginManager §3.7](PluginManager.md#37-content-registration)).
How an operator's `$skill:` reference loads a Skill with the same input is §9.

## 1. Scope and non-goals

The owner is SkillsCatalog, the process part that already scans the user `.agents/skills` root,
the roots plugins registered and the project root. It gains one thing: a *Skill installation* —
a record of a source the user chose, the Skills taken from it, and the files it owns under the
user root.

- **Preview** reads a local directory or a Git repository and returns the Skills it contains,
  without writing anything.
- **Install** copies only the selected Skills into the user skills root, records the source and
  publishes the result to the catalog.
- **Update** re-acquires the recorded source with the recorded selection.
- **Remove** deletes exactly what the record owns.

There is no manifest requirement, no second store and no second plugin. The record is a field of
the Skills business document (`skills.json`), the files live in the user root the catalog already
scans, and publication is the catalog's existing version advance.

Non-goals:

| Not done here | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Project-scope installation | Project Skills come from the project source tree; the project content it carries starts disabled and only the local user configuration can enable it ([ADR 003](../../adr/003-approval-scope.md)). The user scope is the only destination. |
| Executable plugin code, MCP configuration, hooks | They belong to plugin packages (PluginManager) and are enabled and removed there. A source that also contains code installs only its Skills. |
| A Skill editor | The browser never edits Skill files ([web workspace §4.3](../web-workspace.md#43-settings-and-account-management-on-the-local-web-entry)). |
| A market or a source index | Later (plugin management requirements). |
| A filesystem watcher | Refresh stays an explicit operation, as it is today. |
| Per-Skill installations of one source | One installation per source and installation id; its selection is recorded once. Removing one Skill of the selection is a reinstall with the smaller selection. |
| Server-side preview state | The preview is stateless: the caller keeps the preview and passes its revision back. |

## 2. Own contract

### 2.1 Source and revision

A source is a local directory or a Git repository, acquired exactly as PluginManager acquires a
plugin directory: `https://` or `ssh://` only, no submodules, no Git hooks, no terminal prompt, no
local or `ext` transport, and a tree in which no symbolic link leads outside it ([PluginManager
§7](PluginManager.md#7-security)). A local source must be an absolute path
that resolves to a directory and passes the same link check.

Each operation owns one directory, `<home>/.agents/.staging/<random>`, outside every scanned root
and on the same file system as the user skills root: the acquired tree under `work`, the
installation being prepared under `place` and the one it replaces under `old`. The whole directory
is deleted when the operation settles, however it ends; one that an abnormal end left behind is
deleted when the process next starts. The directory is created only by an operation that needs it:
install and update always, preview only to clone a Git source, so previewing a local directory
writes nothing. Apart from that directory, an installation creates and deletes nothing outside the
user skills root.

Every reply and error is a safe projection: a Git URL is reported without user information, query
or fragment, and Git's own error text is never forwarded. The record keeps the URL as given, like
`plugins.json` does.

The **revision** is SkillsCatalog's content identity of a Skill directory: a digest over every
regular file under it, by relative path and content, in sorted order. A path component named
`.git` is skipped, and symbolic links are never followed — a selected Skill that contains one is
refused — so a bundled script or template changes the revision exactly as a `SKILL.md` change does.
Each file is read in chunks, and a file larger than 8 MiB is not digested at all: the preview
reports it as an issue and the install refuses the Skill that holds it, so a bundled asset cannot
grow the process. An installation's revision is the digest over its ordered selection of
source-relative path and per-Skill revision, so the same tree yields the same installation
revision whether it came from a path or a clone, and an unchanged branch is not stale.

### 2.2 Reads

`skills.preview {source, id?, cwd?}` takes a source and the installation id it would install as
(the caller derives it from the source when the user names none), and answers what installing it
could add. It writes nothing. `cwd` is the project directory the caller has open, as
`skills.catalog` takes it: its project root is read for `shadows` and nothing else.

```json
{
  "source": {"git": "https://example.com/acme/skills", "ref": "main", "commit": "1a2b3c4d"},
  "skills": [
    {"path": "writing/review", "name": "review", "description": "Reviews a change against its spec.",
     "revision": "sha256:…"}
  ],
  "conflicts": [],
  "shadows": [
    {"path": "tooling/lint", "name": "lint", "by": "plugin:kit:tooling/lint"}
  ],
  "issues": [{"path": "broken/SKILL.md", "message": "missing description"}]
}
```

- `skills` lists every Skill the scan found, in scan order, by its source-relative directory
  (`path`), the `name` and `description` its frontmatter declares, and the `revision` of its
  files. `path` is the selection identity: a name may repeat across sources, a path cannot within
  one tree. The revision is what the install compares against, so a caller cannot install content
  it did not see.
- `source` echoes what was read, projected like every other reply: a canonical path, or the Git
  URL with the commit that was acquired, so the caller can show what the selection belongs to.
- `conflicts` are reasons the install would be refused with this selection: a Skill whose name is
  already provided by another Skill in the *user* root, where the winner would depend on
  traversal order rather than on a defined precedence. The Skills of the installation named by
  `id` are not conflicts: a replace excludes its own.
- `shadows` is information: the user root precedes plugin and project roots, so installing the
  Skill hides a Skill of that name from those roots. The catalog reports it after the fact as
  `shadowedBy`; before the install the user decides.
- `issues` are the scan's per-file problems, in the shape `skills.catalog` already returns. A tree
  with issues can still be installed; the selected paths must exist in `skills`.
- There is no pagination and no cursor: the list is bounded by the scan limits the catalog already
  applies (1000 `SKILL.md` files, depth 10, 4000-character metadata budget applies to model lists
  only), and the caller filters the list it holds. A source that exceeds the limit reports
  `ScanLimitReached` and the Skills found so far.

`skills.installations` reads what was installed and from where:

```json
{
  "installations": [
    {
      "id": "acme-skills",
      "source": {"git": "https://example.com/acme/skills", "ref": "main", "commit": "1a2b3c4d"},
      "revision": "sha256:…",
      "skills": [{"path": "writing/review", "id": "user:acme-skills/writing/review"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

The read carries no `name`, `enabled` or `shadowedBy`: those are catalog facts, and the caller
joins by Skill id. A recorded Skill that the catalog does not list is simply absent from the
catalog until the installation is updated or removed.

### 2.3 Install

```json
{
  "source": {"path": "/src/acme-skills"},
  "id": "acme-skills",
  "skills": [{"path": "writing/review", "revision": "sha256:…"}],
  "overwrite": false
}
```

Order:

1. Validate the request shape at the boundary: source shape, `id` (`[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`), a
   non-empty selection of distinct paths.
2. Acquire the source and scan it. A selected Skill whose files now digest to another revision is
   `skills_preview_stale`; the reply names the path and the revision found, and nothing else
   happens.
3. Check the selection against the scan: every path is one the scan found and directly contains
   `SKILL.md`; no two selected Skills declare the same name; no user-root Skill outside this
   installation provides one of those names; no selected Skill contains a symbolic link.
4. Check the destination `<user skills root>/<id>`. Only a directory the record owns is replaced:
   an id the record holds needs `overwrite`, and a directory or file at `<user skills root>/<id>`
   that no record owns is `skills_install_unmanaged`, reporting the Skills found there, because the
   user root is also where hand-written Skills live. Nothing outside `<user skills root>/<id>` is
   ever written or deleted.
5. Copy the selected Skill directories, keeping their source-relative paths, into `place`; rename
   the existing `<user skills root>/<id>`, when there is one, to `old`; rename `place` to
   `<user skills root>/<id>`. A replacing install keeps its id and replaces the selection as a
   whole; the previous directory is deleted with the operation directory.
6. Commit the record through the Skills storage port, which writes the Skills business document
   with revision-conflict retry.
7. Rescan the user root, advance the catalog version and announce it, so a Session sees the Skills
   before the reply.

A failure in 2–5 leaves the previous installation and the record untouched. A failure in 6 removes
the new files and restores the previous directory. The reply carries the installation it replaced
under `previous` (absent when it created one), so the caller can show what changed.

`id` is optional. Without it, the owner derives it from the source's last path component
(`owner/repo` → `repo`), ASCII-lowercased, characters outside `[a-z0-9_-]` replaced by `-`,
truncated to 64, empty → `skills`. The derivation never reads user information from a Git URL, so
a credential-bearing and a clean URL of the same repository derive the same id. A derived id that
is recorded for a different source is `skills_install_exists`, and the user names one explicitly.

### 2.4 Update

`skills.update` takes an installation id and re-acquires the recorded source: a Git source at its
recorded ref (the default branch when none was recorded), a local source at its recorded path.
The recorded selection must still exist in the new tree; a path that disappeared refuses the
update with its name and changes nothing, because dropping a Skill the user chose is not an
update. The installation's revision and Git commit advance; the id and selection do not. The reply
carries the record before the update under `previous`, so the caller can show whether anything
changed: equal revisions mean the source had not moved. Update is also the repair for a recorded
installation whose directory was removed by hand.

The record read before the source is acquired is what the update may replace. The install compares
it with the record under its lock: one that another client removed, or replaced with another source
or revision, while the source was being acquired refuses with `skills_install_unknown` and changes
nothing, so a slow clone cannot undo a removal or a newer installation.

### 2.5 Remove

`skills.remove` takes an installation id, deletes `<user skills root>/<id>` after the same shape
check the owner applies to its own directories (exactly that path, real directories, no symbolic
link component), removes the record, rescans the user root and advances the version; its reply is
the new catalog version. A recorded installation whose directory is already gone removes its
record only. Unrelated Skills, other installations and plugin-owned Skills are untouched.

If deleting the files fails, the record is kept and the reply says so, whether or not every file
was removed: the record is the only proof of what the installation owns, so it cannot be dropped
first. The user retries; the next update reinstalls the files.

### 2.6 Ownership boundary with PluginManager

A Skill installation is not a plugin: it has no manifest, no loader row, no enablement state of
its own, and no `plugin.*` operation accepts it. `skills.install` creates an installation, or
replaces one the record holds when the user confirms `overwrite`; an id that matches a plugin's
name is simply a new installation, and installing it changes no plugin state. `skills.update` and
`skills.remove` accept only ids the Skills record holds, and answer `skills_install_unknown` for
anything else, a plugin id included.
Plugin packages that carry Skills stay visible in the same settings page and keep their lifecycle
(`plugin.enable`, `plugin.disable`, `plugin.update`, `plugin.remove`), and their Skills keep the
`plugin:<plugin id>:` ids and the `pluginSkills` roots SkillsCatalog already holds.

### 2.7 Errors

| Code | When | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills_source_invalid` | the source is not an absolute directory, is not an `https://`/`ssh://` URL, or a link in the tree leaves it | correct the source |
| `skills_acquire_failed` | the clone or the staging directory failed | retry; check access to the repository |
| `skills_preview_stale` | a selected Skill's files changed since the preview, bundled files included | preview again and reselect |
| `skills_selection_invalid` | an install id that is not `[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, an empty or repeated selection, a path the scan did not find, a repeated name in the selection, a link inside a selected Skill, or a Skill file larger than the digest limit | correct the request |
| `skills_install_exists` | the id is recorded and `overwrite` is false | confirm overwrite or choose another id |
| `skills_install_unknown` | update or remove of an id the record does not hold, or an update whose record was removed or replaced while its source was acquired | refresh `skills.installations` and retry |
| `skills_install_unmanaged` | `<user skills root>/<id>` exists but no record owns it; the reply names the Skills found there | choose another id, or move that directory |
| `skills_install_conflict` | a selected name is already provided by a user-root Skill outside this installation | remove or rename the other Skill, or drop the selection |
| `skills_install_failed` | copying or swapping the files failed; the previous state was restored | retry |
| `skills_write_failed`, `skills_conflict` | the record could not be written; the previous state was restored | retry; when the document changed, read it again and retry |
| `skills_remove_failed` | deleting the recorded files failed; the record was kept | retry; fix permissions |
| `skill_unknown`, `skills_sync_failed`, `skills_unavailable` | unchanged, from the existing catalog and enablement contract | unchanged |

## 3. Events and state

The installation record is part of the Skills business document in the user scope: one map from
installation id to its source, revision and selected paths. It is written only through the Skills
storage port (`SkillSettings`), the same path that already carries the disabled ids and the plugin
roots, with the same revision-conflict retry. Fields this version does not know are preserved, so
a newer document read by an older process is not lost, and no format version is introduced: the
document has always tolerated unknown members and the new field is additive.

The record is business memory that survives a reload; nothing else is stored. The preview is not
kept, not on the host and not in the browser's persistence.

No Timeline event and no new bus event: publication is `skills.catalog_changed {version}`, which
SkillsCatalog already emits when its version advances, and the Session and branch views react to
it as they do today. The version advances only after the record is committed, so a listener never
observes files the record does not own.

`skills.json` after one git installation and one hand-written Skill:

```json
{
  "disabledSkillIds": ["user:archive"],
  "installations": {
    "acme-skills": {
      "source": {"git": "https://example.com/acme/skills", "ref": "main", "commit": "1a2b3c4d"},
      "revision": "sha256:…",
      "skills": ["writing/review", "writing/edit"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Dependencies

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `P:HostPlatform` | The user skills root and the home the staging directory hangs under. |
| `P:SkillSettingsHost` | Read and write the Skills document: disabled ids, plugin roots and installations. |
| `P:ManagementMethods` | Register the five methods under the `skills` namespace, which the App Server's SkillsCatalog plugin already owns. |
| `P:PartRegistry` | Unchanged; the Session and branch parts these methods do not touch. |

The App Server's SkillsCatalog plugin keeps the wire boundary: it acquires a source, projects
replies, and calls the owner. The catalog keeps everything after acquisition: validation, files,
record and publication. Route management methods behind the existing local-transport admission;
paired and legacy clients see `local_transport_required` exactly as for `skills.catalog`.

Acquisition and the link check are the crate's existing implementation
(`crates/dim-app-server/src/plugin_manager/acquire.rs`), used here and by PluginManager: one place
states the rules, and the two callers differ only in the destination they own, the staging
directory they use and the record they write. Skills states none of them again.

## 5. Cross-module requirements

**R1. Web workspace: separate installed-skill management from installation ([§4.3](../web-workspace.md#43-settings-and-account-management-on-the-local-web-entry)).**

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Problem | Installed-skill management and source installation are different operator tasks. Admitting installation methods on the authenticated local Web entry does not require installation forms on its Skills page. |
| Why existing mechanisms do not suffice | `plugin.install` installs a whole package and requires a manifest; it cannot replace Skills' source-installation contract. Browser-side filesystem or Git writes would duplicate the owner. |
| Required capability and ordering | The Skills page manages installed skills through catalog, enablement and refresh operations only, following the Web workspace interaction contract. Source preview, selective installation, update, removal and installation records remain Skills-owned operations, admitted on the authenticated local Web entry and advertised only when the server provides them; admission does not require this page to render them. Plugin-package installation and activation remain on Plugins. |
| Owner and issue | Web workspace ([WebEntry](../web-workspace.md)); #740. |

**R2. Settings: none.** The installations field is Skills' own document content and needs no new
Settings capability; the source stays registered by the same plugin that registers it today.

## 6. Rule check

| Rule | How this design complies |
| --- | --- |
| §1 Capability and App Server boundary; ADR 002 D1 | The owner of the state is the process: the record is Skills' business document, the files are in Skills' user root, and the catalog version is the publication. No new process, Session or branch part, no wiring module, and the App Server keeps only acquisition and the wire boundary. |
| §4.1 split by state owner | Discovery, enablement and installations are one state owner and one part; PluginManager keeps plugin rows and plugin content, and neither part reads the other's state. |
| §4.2 commands, not direct control | Skills is asked for an operation by a typed method call; it writes its own record and advances its own version. Nothing else writes `skills.json`, and the browser writes nothing. |
| §4.3 handlers register work and return | The methods are ordinary provider calls with `Interruption::Report`; acquisition and copying run inside the call, a cancelled call settles before the reply, and no handler writes a Timeline event. |
| §4.4 state and rebuild | The record is business memory read back from Settings after a reload; filesystem state is the installation's own I/O resource and is settled to a terminal state (present, or recorded and repaired by update). Producible facts stay out of the Timeline because nothing outside Skills decides on them. |
| §4.7 public events and services | The only observable signal is the existing `skills.catalog_changed {version}`; no new service, event or port. |
| §4.8 requirements raised | R1 and R2 above, in the §4 rule 8 format; acquisition adds none, because it is the same crate-internal implementation (§4). |
| §4.9 ordering | The record commits before the version advances; a removal deletes files before the record, because the record is what proves ownership. |
| ADR 002 D4 configuration | No structural configuration: no loader row, no enablement flag of its own. `skills.json` stays business configuration. |
| ADR 002 D5 language-neutral contract | §2 is stated as source, revision, selection, id and outcomes in neutral terms; the Rust and JSON spellings are in the appendix. |
| ADR 003 / file-root authorization | Installation grants no authority: an installed Skill is an instruction file the model loads like any other, and a source is read only where the operation names it. |

Ablation: no preview cache, no preview registry, no second root kind, no second store, no second
plugin, no per-Skill record, no new event, no pagination cursor, no progress declaration (the Web
renders a busy state; acquisition phases have no consumer today). The preview is stateless and the
install re-acquires, so the only added state is the record plus one staging directory that is
removed when the operation settles.

## 7. Binding appendix

Method declarations, in the App Server's `SkillsCatalog` plugin (Rust), `mutating` and
`Interruption::Report` as shown; `skills.preview` and `skills.installations` are not mutating:

```text
skills.preview        read
skills.install        mutating, no progress
skills.update         mutating, no progress
skills.remove         mutating, no progress
skills.installations  read
```

Owner-side additions (Rust, `dim-agent-capabilities`):

```rust
pub struct SkillInstallation {
    pub source: SkillInstallSource,
    /// Revision of the installed selection, in install order.
    pub revision: String,
    /// Source-relative Skill directories, in install order.
    pub skills: Vec<String>,
}

/// One selected Skill. `revision` is what the caller reviewed: `Some` must
/// match the tree, `None` accepts whatever the source holds (an update).
pub struct SelectedSkill {
    pub path: String,
    pub revision: Option<String>,
}

pub enum SkillInstallSource {
    Path { path: PathBuf },
    /// `reference` is serialized as `ref`, as in `plugins.json`.
    Git { git: String, reference: Option<String>, commit: String },
}

/// What an install may replace at `<user root>/<id>`.
pub enum Replace {
    /// Create it; a recorded id is `InstallationExists`.
    Create,
    /// Replace what the record holds now, or create it (`overwrite`).
    Recorded,
    /// Replace exactly this record; anything else is `UnknownInstallation`.
    Expected(SkillInstallation),
}

// SkillSettings gains, next to set_plugin:
fn set_installation(
    self: Arc<Self>, id: String, installation: Option<SkillInstallation>,
    cancel: CancellationToken,
) -> BoxFuture<'static, Result<SettingsVersion, SkillSettingsError>>;
```

Owner operations on the catalog: `preview(root, id, cwd)`, `install(id, source, root,
operation_dir, skills, replace)`, `uninstall(id)`, `installation(id)` and `installations()`. The
first two return the previous record and the new catalog version.

`SkillSettingsSnapshot` gains `installations: BTreeMap<String, SkillInstallation>`, and
`SkillDocument` in the App Server serializes it under `installations` with unknown members
preserved. New `SkillsError` variants: `InstallationExists`, `UnknownInstallation`,
`StalePreview { expected, found }`, `SelectionInvalid(String)`, `InstallConflict(String)`,
`UnmanagedDirectory(String)`, `InstallIo(String)`; the App Server maps them to the codes in §2.7.
`SourceInvalid` and `AcquireFailed` stay on the App Server side, where acquisition happens.

## 8. Acceptance

Owner flows, in [skills.rs](../../../tests/integration/tests/skills.rs), over a disposable home
and a source directory with several Skills and no manifest:

- preview lists every Skill with its source path, description, revision and issues, and writes
  nothing; a change to a bundled file under a selected Skill changes its revision;
- install copies only the selected Skill directories, leaves other files in the home and the
  project untouched, and the catalog lists them under `user:<id>/…` before the reply;
- a `SKILL.md` or a bundled file changed between preview and install refuses with
  `skills_preview_stale` and writes nothing;
- a name already provided in the user root, a repeated name in the selection, a `..` or absolute
  selection path, and a source whose link leaves it are each refused, with nothing written;
- install over an existing installation needs `overwrite`, and with it replaces the selection
  without touching another installation or a hand-written Skill; a directory or file at
  `<user skills root>/<id>` that the record does not own is refused with the Skills it holds, left
  as it is, and `overwrite` does not change that;
- a bundled file larger than the digest limit is a preview issue and refuses the install; a record
  write that fails after the swap restores the previous directory and record;
- update keeps the selection, refuses a selected path that disappeared, reports the previous
  revision and commit, repairs a directory removed by hand, and refuses when its record was removed
  or replaced while the source was acquired;
- remove deletes only `<user skills root>/<id>` and its record, and removes a record whose
  directory is already gone;
- the record survives a catalog reload and a process restart.

App Server flows, in [transport_flow](../../../crates/dim-app-server/tests/transport_flow/), over
a disposable home and a local Git fixture: preview, install, catalog, update to a new commit and
remove through the real protocol; the Web entry advertises the five methods while a remote and a
legacy connection refuse them; a credential-bearing URL and a failing clone produce replies and
errors without the URL or Git's stderr; a source whose link leaves it, a directory no record owns
and a path source's preview write nothing outside the expected places; the staging root an
abnormal end leaves behind is gone after a restart; `skills.json` keeps unrelated fields and a
document written before this field existed still loads.

Rendered verification follows the [Web workspace's Skills interaction](../web-workspace.md#skills-interaction):
desktop and compact layouts, installed catalog, search, scope, collapsed details, enablement,
shadowed entries, reload, empty lists and failure recovery. Source preview, selective installation,
overwrite, update and removal are verified through the owner and App Server flows above, not
through installation forms on the Skills page.

## 9. References load with the operator's input

An operator names a Skill with `$skill: <name>` in the input. That reference loads the Skill
deterministically, before the model is asked, with the same input: no new input, no model round
trip, and no AgentLoop change. The design is:

- **The mechanism is `SubmitChecks`.** The Skills Session part registers the check `skills` with
  the Session's `submitChecks` ([Hooks A.6.2](Hooks.md#a62-submit-check-at-the-operator-input-entries)),
  the table Hooks' `UserPromptSubmit` uses. `session.submit` and the steer of
  `session.input.withdraw` call it before writing, and the blocks it returns are appended to the
  operator input's `user` content after the operator's own content, so the block is part of the
  input that drives the request and is recorded in the Timeline. The check is named `skills`, so
  its blocks follow `hooks`' in name order. `session.branch_create` returns no blocks: a
  branch's first input is built from the prompt alone.
- **The marker is plain text.** A reference is `$skill:`, optional spaces, then the run of
  non-whitespace characters that follows, matched exactly against the enabled Skill names. Plain
  text keeps the composer free of atomic tokens and needs no argument syntax; `/` is the only
  trigger, and `@` stays the file picker. A Skill whose name contains whitespace cannot be
  referenced, and the palette does not list it.
- **Lookup is the `skill` tool's view.** The check reads `SessionSkills::current()`: the enabled
  Skills of the Session's current view. A disabled or unknown name adds nothing, and a view
  error, a stopped part or a reloading part adds nothing: an error is no opinion. Each Skill is
  resolved once, in the order of its first reference. References are read from the operator's own
  content only: a block that starts with a runtime marker, which includes the blocks every submit
  check adds, never adds one, so a steer of a queued input loads the same Skills as its submit.
- **One block per Skill.** The block is `<dim-skill name="{name}">`, the exact text the `skill`
  tool returns, and `</dim-skill>`. The name is escaped with the attribute escaping every
  `<dim-…>` marker uses, and one function renders the loaded text for both the tool result and
  the block, so the two paths cannot drift. The block is a text block of the input's `user`
  content, never a raw block, so the input stays operator input.
- **The model-facing text says which path loaded the Skill.** The instructions state that a
  `$skill: name` marker followed in the same message by a `<dim-skill name="name">` block means
  the Skill is already loaded: follow it, and do not call `skill` for it. A marker without such
  a block is loaded with the tool, as today. Every other rule stays.
- **Consumers see the block where hook contexts appear.** SessionTitle's title text and Recall
  read the input's `user` content, so they see the added block after the operator's text,
  exactly as they see a `UserPromptSubmit` context (Hooks A.6.2). That is accepted.
- **Clients show one line.** A text block of an operator input's `user` content that is not the
  first block and starts with `<dim-skill name="` is shown as one line naming the loaded Skill,
  never as its text ([clients](../clients.md)). The ACP gateway applies the same rule when it
  replays an input to the editor on `session/load` and on a history read. A prefill for edit or
  fork takes the operator's text only, so resending does not load the Skill twice. Export keeps
  the raw record.
